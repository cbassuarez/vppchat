Welcome to **VPP Studio** 👋

This is the **single canonical Welcome chat** shared across **Console / Studio / Atlas**.

### How this app is structured
**Project ▸ Track ▸ Scene ▸ Block**
- **Conversation blocks** are “sessions” (Console shows the same thing).
- **Document blocks** are saved notes (from Console “Save block”, etc.).

### How to talk to the system (VPP)
Start your message with a tag on line 1:
- `!<g>` grounding / concept
- `!<q>` questions
- `!<o>` outputs / implementation
- `!<c>` corrections

### Try this now
```text
!<g>
What are we building, and what should I do next?
If you ever feel lost: open Command Space, search “Welcome”, and jump back here.
